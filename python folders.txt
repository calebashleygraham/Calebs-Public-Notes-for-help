This README is for explating what to do before you even start programming due to our classes software we couldn't do 
this so I'm just going to write out what you will need to do in this program 
first I will treat this as a proper project so you will learn proper naming for project files and folders for example if i put
this in a folder i would of called this main.py in a folder called scourse reson why is simple but it will be explained in the
step by step section which is now 

step 1 install python3/anaconda 
the install is normally a very simple as run the installer, make sure that you have PATHS box tickt once you see it as it
will setup the cmd paths for you incase you are using cmd for running the software

step 2 using pip/conda 
this is a tool used for install libarise as we will be using them for the deep learning tasks and there is a very important 
one called virtualenv to install it just type this line into the command line 
pip install virtualenv 

this software allow you to manage separate package installations for different projects. 
They essentially allow you to create a “virtual” isolated Python installation and install packages into that virtual installation. 
When you switch projects, you can simply create a new virtual environment and not have to worry about breaking the packages installed in the other environments. 
It is always recommended to use a virtual environment while developing Python applications.

this will also be the project folder where we start from. So in other ways this could also be the step 1 
next we shall create the virtual environment using this line below
py -m venv env 

the env is the folder name so you will want to change that to the name of project once in that folder you will create the scource 
folder and put the main.py in there 

to activate the environment in your console you will need to use this line
.\env\Scripts\activate 
remember that env name is changed 
to end the venv just type deactivate in the console now we can get to the program
